> Who I am? That is also the question I ask myself sometimes.

### My Past

I am Ghislain and I changed career in web development in June 2022 and I don't regret anything.

I just finished a Master's degree in Chemistry.
I did a lot of intership and had some experiences in R&D laboratory and I really liked it.

I liked the fact to read new articles in order to create new materials in order to test it and get a better accuracy for what application I was doing.

There was a lot of mistakes and errors from my experiments because what you see doesn't work because the author forgot to mentioned an important factors, some reactants are slightly different that expected.

I liked this field but I didn't get alot of opportunities and I was scared about my health (use of hazardous materials which can have an effect on cancer for example)
I was kind of lost and my mental health took a really big hit post-covid period.

### The switch

But actually, few years before this falldown, I have been learning about HTML/CSS, Photoshop and After Effects and I really liked.

I appreciate the fact that you can work by yourlsef and improve and you don't need to be at your job to improve and be a better person.

After a lot of thinking, I decided to learn and change career. I started to learn by myself using Udemy with 100 learn Python and Web development.

I wanted to change career as fast as possible, so i decided to enroll into a bootcamp.

I decided to learn France and go to Thailand to learn Code in Paradise with Haiku Academy.
This bootcamp was just amazing and I learned a lot of professional way of coding that it is hard to get when you learn alone (but not impossible though)

### Things are moving now

After this training, I decided to create a food POS project using my knowledge from my bootcamp and learning new things everyday.
I really tried to add the most new things in this project, while being coherent.
I learned about SCSS, TypeScript, Postgres, advanced MongoDB and NestJS.

I really love doing it.

I decided to stay in Thailand to look for a job and less than 3 months after my bootcamp finished, I was hired at HAUP as an Associate Full Stack Developer.

I didn't expected to be honest and I would to thank the company for giving the opportunity even I didn't hqve knowledge at that time.

So, today, I finally finished my blog where I will post about web development topics.
I will approve the features along the way, like my personal history
