## Introduction

You probably heard a lot about web application.
For those who don't know, I am going to describe you using an analogy: a restaurant.

Yes, you understood me clear, a restaurant?
You probably say behind your screen. What, Ghislain, what is the link?

Okay, let me explain.
Now let's dismistify web development by using the digfferent sections of the restaurant:

## Restaurant

### Dining Room ðŸ¥•

Each restaurant have their own mood, identity, lightling, environment. Then, you can choose the food that you want on the menu.

In web development, this is what you see on the website, colors, buttons, images how the site responds when you interact with it.

<div class='md-alert'>
For example, when you want to book your new hotels, you click on a button to book it.
</div>

<span class='md-callout'>This is called front-end</span>

### Kitchen

The chef are preparing the food when the order is coming in. They look through the incventory if they have enough foods to prepare what you ordered.

The kitchen is what you don't see and this is exactly the same in the web development.

In web development, this is the server-side where data is stored and manipulated from database (similar to kitchen food inventory).

<div class='md-alert'>
For example, you just book a new hotel, the system is going to check if your information are valid, process the payment
</div>

<span class='md-callout'>This is called back-end</span>

### Waitstaff

In a restaurant, the waitstaff takes your order and brings you your food. They are the link between the kitchen and the dining room and the kitchen.

A similar logic can be applied for web development and this is called API (Application Programming Interface).

<strong>
This system allows the front-end and back-end to communicate and exchange data.
</strong>

<div class='md-alert'>When booking an hotel, the paylent and booking infoamtions are send to server, and you receive that the hotel was successfully boojed with all the informations you need (location, duration, ...)</div>

<span class='md-callout'>This is called API (Application Programming Interface)</span>

## My thoughts

Actually, this analogy is really powerful.
When I was working remotely during Christmas time, my mom always asked me how was the work.

I always said to her that some table are broken or too small (I had issues on creating a calendar-like table), the waiterstaff is not enough trained (I was missing some data and didn't write the proper code to get what I want) or the chef didn' have enough food for the service.

It was quite funny but I didn't to get deeper into details and lost her after 2-3 minutes of discussions.

Now you know exactly what is web development and I hope you complety understand what is it now.

If you are interested for me, I will publish more posts on web development
COMING SOON...

And thank for you reading, i appreciate a lot
