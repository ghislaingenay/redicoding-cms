In this article, we will discuss how to scale a NodeJS application.
This scale can be done using 3 axis called the <strong>Scale Cube</strong>.

<div class='md-alert'>
The cube is divided in 3 differents axis:
<ul>
<li>ðŸ‘‰ Cloning (X-axis)</li>
<li>ðŸ‘‰ Partitioning (Z-axis)</li>
<li>ðŸ‘‰ Microservices (Y-axis)</li>
<ul>
</div>

## 1. Cloning

To simplify, Cloning is running multiples instances of an application and splitting the traffic between those instances

> JS is single-threated so it contains only one processor

You probably already know what technology could be used: <code class='md-code'>Load Balancer</code>, <code class='md-code'>Kubernetes</code>

- ðŸ–¥ Load Balancer: system that split the traffic between those instances
- ðŸ–¥ Kubernetes: restart machine (or pods) automatically when they are down

## 2. Partitioning

> Split database up in to several instances that are only responsible for a part of the whole dataset

<span class='md-alert'>This is also called <strong>Horizontal Partitioning</strong> or <strong>Sharding</strong></span>

Each database is called a Shard.

Partition can be done via different factors:

- ðŸ‘‰ Alphabet (A-K L-R S-Z)
- ðŸ‘‰ Region (Northeast, MidWest, West, SouthWest)
- ðŸ‘‰ Identifiers (age)

You can use different databases depending on your usage and business requirements:

- => MongoDB (mongos)
- => Postgres (Postgres-XL)
- => MySQL(Fabric, Router)
- => Elasticsearch (Lucene)
- => Redis (Redis Cluster, Amazon ElastiCache for Redis)

## 3. Microservices

A microservice handle one specific feature of the application and run independently of other services

> A microservice can scale by himself without scaling other service

## 4. Conclusion

This was a short resume of the scaling methods inside NodeJS application
If you are interested by one of these elements or the use of databases, please let me know.
